# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
### Build-A-Chord



## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a wavetable synthesizer.") 
### My project will be a somewhat of a "Build-A-Chord". Where I use scanf to give the user the freedom to create whatever chord they want and whatever sound they want, with ease. 





## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
### My patcher will ask the user a series of questions about what they want their Build-A-Chord to sound like, what pitch they would like, and how long they want the note to last. I want to use scanf and give them options that would be understood to the general population. For example, if I were to ask how fast they want the attact time to be, the scanf would say "Would you like a gentle sound or a harder strike sound?" 



## If you are planning to combine EP-353's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to EP-353, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

### N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will make it so that my code can at least compile with little to no errors.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I could get the code to implement and generate at least 1 audio file.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Best outcome is a working interactive code that will give the user the ability to build their chord. Working ADSR, working everything.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

I will need to brush up on my audio implementation and using multiple different things we've learned over the semester to maximize the variability of this code. I will need to figure out the best order to put the code in (i.e, wave type, pitch, key, adsr, effects). I will also need to make sure I am implementing the codes in the right way in order to return minimal errors.
