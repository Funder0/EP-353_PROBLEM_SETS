#HELLO WORLD!

*A paragraph describing my experience running HelloWorld.c in the C language.*

From what I can tell, running the code is analogous to speaking to someone through a translator. When we write the code in c, **Visual Studio** translates it into a code that the computer understands, the computer completes the action, and spits out the order given by the Code Pilot (that's me). Some commands I ran were the `cd` change directory to access the `HelloWorld.c` file, `clang` to run the code in C language, and the `./`command to actually run the code and see the result, which was "Hello World!" showing up on the under the place I wrote the commands. I tried changing the texts between the `""` and I could make the code say whatever I wanted (which was fun).
