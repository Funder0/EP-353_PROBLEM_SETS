# BUILD-A-CHORD MANUAL

Hello user! Welcome to your step-by-step guide to use the brand new Build-A-Chord code. It's easy! All you have to do is choose what you want, and we use our handy code to generate the chord. We have GUARANTEED TWO SECOND DELIVERY!!!!!!!!! I'm telling you folk's it can't get any better than this. Okay let's get right down to it. Here is how you can get yourself a chord!

## Step 1: Pull Origin
If it is your first time opening the code, you will have to pull the origin. The first thing you need to do is open your GitHub Desktop, a networking app in which you can share codes between users. On the top left, make sure your CURRENT REPOSITORY is set to `EP-353_PROBLEM_SETS`. 

When it is open, you will need to press the `Fetch Origin` icon. A gray (1) icon will show up indicating that there is a new item that needs to be pulled. Click the same spot you clicked to fetch the origin, and the folder should appear under the `History` tab. Your origin has officially been pulled!


## Step 2: Open Visual Studio Code

Now is the time where you open the code. Now that your origin is nice and pulled, you can open the Visual Studio Code app. There should be a new folder in the `EP-353_PROBLEM_SETS` tab called `FINAL`. In this tab, you will see a code file called `Build-A-Chord`. Click that and then you will have opened the code.

## Step 3: Compiling the Code
This is the fun part! To compile the code, you must open the terminal, where you give the computer the command. There will be a tab under the code window that says `TERMINAL`. Click that.

Forst you must make sure you change your directory so that the right folder is selected. In the terminal window, type `cd`, press the space bar, and then drag the `FINAL` folder into the typing window. Then you press `ENTER`.

Next you will have to get the software to read the code in C Language. In order to do this, yopu must type `clang Build-A-Chord.c -lsndfile`. Then press `ENTER`.

The last step is to type `./a.out` and press `ENTER`, and then follow the directions given in the terminal. It will prompt you to answer the questions by typing in numbers corresponding to the options given.

## Step 4: Opening Your Audio File
If you typed in your numbers correctly, then within seconds you should see a file called `CustomChord.wav` in the `FINAL` folder. You will find this file in your finder, then press space bar. The audio file should play, and you'll have your own chord generated with the Build-A-Chord code. Happy chording!
